# Retro Quest
Retro Quest ⚔️
A tile-based 2D RPG built from scratch with Java 25 and Swing. This project implements core game engine mechanics—including a custom game loop, collision detection, and sprite animation—following the logic of the RyiSnow tutorial series.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of Retro Quest is to develop a fully functional 2D adventure game without relying on external heavy-duty game engines. By using native Java libraries, the project focuses on understanding the low-level "heartbeat" of a video game.
